      <p>FrameRush is a boutique film distributor specializing in releasing films that amaze us with their exceptional storytelling, unique voice and inventiveness.</p>

<p>Our mission is to meticulously curate and release films that capture our imagination and passions. We aim to prove ourselves as experts in the rapidly shifting world of digital and traditional distribution.  Most importantly, we strive to create an honest and personal dialogue with our audience and foster a love of film everywhere we can.
We feel that each of our films deserve a lovingly crafted release and marketing effort rivaling the passion and spirit that went into each production.</p>

<p>FrameRush believes the audience should be able to enjoy our films in whatever venue, platform,  or format they prefer. We strive to make every effort to make that process as smooth and convenient as possible. After all, film is made to be enjoyed and its time to stop letting technology get in the way of that experience.</p>
